# Amazon Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website that I built using HTML and CSS. It recreates the core layout and design elements of Amazonâ€™s homepage, including a responsive header with a search bar, product listings, and a well-structured footer. I paid close attention to replicating Amazon's user-friendly interface to provide a similar experience in terms of design and layout.

In addition to the static layout, I have included a functional button "Today's Deals" on the page. When clicked, this button (Today's Deals) navigates the user to a different page, adding a layer of interactivity to the project. This functionality was implemented by linking a separate HTML file to ensure seamless navigation.

This project was primarily developed to sharpen my front-end development skills by focusing on structuring HTML and applying CSS for a visually appealing design. Moving forward, I plan to expand the project by incorporating more interactive features like JavaScript-based functionalities and perhaps even backend integration.
