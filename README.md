# Amazon Clone

# Overview
I created this Amazon clone using HTML and CSS to mimic the design and layout of the Amazon website. The main purpose of this project was to practice and enhance my front-end development skills by replicating an e-commerce website interface.
Features
•	Responsive Layout: The page includes a navigation bar with a search bar, product display sections, and a footer.
•	Navigation: A button is implemented on the page that, when clicked, redirects users to another page, providing basic interactivity.
•	Clean Design: The overall look closely resembles Amazon’s design, focusing on user experience and a clear layout.

# Purpose
The goal of this project was to:
•	Understand and apply HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing web layout.
•	Learn how to structure web pages effectively.
•	Implement basic navigation between different pages for a more interactive user experience.

# Future Improvements
•	Add JavaScript for enhanced interactivity (e.g., search functionality, product filtering).
•	Integrate a backend to handle user data and transactions.
•	Make the design more dynamic with animations and hover effects.
